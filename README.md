# Alphabet-Recognition
Aim - Classification of the features extracted from images as one of the 26 capital letters in English Alphabet using machine learning algorithms without using built-in libraries.

Methods - Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and ANN

#Dataset
Dataset consists of 20000 instances each having 16 numerical attributes ranging from 0-15. Dataset is divided into training-16000 and test-4000. The dataset is a balanced dataset and is also available online at:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/letter+recognition

The details of the dataset are given in the following link:

Running main.m runs 3 version of Naive Bayes implemented, Logistic regression and ANN with one layer and two layer network.

The ipython file (Alphabet.ipynb) contains the implementation of the whole code in python along with comparison of our results with decision trees and random forests
